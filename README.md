This firmware allows the SP8 Alarm Panel to talk to Honeywell/Residio 6160 and 6139 keypads. 
It translates the CBUS protocol from the SP8 alarm panel into the Honeywell/Residio ECP protocol.
This firmware is intended to be loaded into the KPA1 adapter board. The code is compiled using
platformio and Visual Code Studio. It will need to be downloaded into the board using a suitable
JTAG adapter.
